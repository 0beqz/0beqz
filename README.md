Hey! I'm 0beqz and I love working on graphics projects for three.js including:

- [SSGI](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects/tree/main/src/ssgi): Real-time global illumination on the web

- [SSR](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects/tree/main/src/ssgi): Screen-space reflections to spice up your scene's realism and specular lighting

- [TRAA](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects/tree/main/src/traa): Cinematic anti-aliasing to make your scene appear more filmic and less pixelated

- [Motion Blur](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects/tree/main/src/motion-blur): Adds smearing to your screen when moving the camera which gives a cinematic effect often seen in real cameras and games

- [SVGF](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects/tree/main/src/svgf): Modern variance-guided denoiser using temporal reprojection to minimize the noise in raytraced images

- [Temporal Reprojection](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects/tree/main/src/temporal-reproject): General-purpose pass that's used to properly reproject the last frame into the current frame as well as deal with all sorts of disocclusion issues to reduce temporal lag - useful for enabling lower per-frame sample counts in effects involving GI, AO and reflections

ðŸŽ‡ What I'm currently working on:
- [realism-effects](https://github.com/0beqz/realism-effects): SSGI, Motion Blur, TRAA - effects to enhance your three.js scene's realism
- [screen-space-reflections](https://github.com/0beqz/screen-space-reflections): Implements Screen Space Reflections in three.js
- [enhance-shader-lighting](https://github.com/0beqz/enhance-shader-lighting): Better lighting in three.js

ðŸŽ† What I've worked on:
- [three-billboard-reflection](https://github.com/0beqz/three-billboard-reflection): Performant plane reflections in three.js
- [lightmap_interior_test](https://github.com/0beqz/lightmap_interior_test): Three.js lightmap interior test
- [env-map-importance-sampling-tiles](https://github.com/0beqz/env-map-importance-sampling-tiles): Generates tiles of an env map for importance sampling the environment in a Monte Carlo Ray Tracer


ðŸ‘‰ If my work helps you and you'd like to support it, then I'd appreciate you [donating or sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/0beqz). Thanks!
